# Echo Consumer and Provider (Cloud)

In this example, two Arrowhead systems interact while using the service
registration, authorization and orchestration capabilities of the three
Arrowhead core systems with the corresponding names. The first interacting
system provides a service the another system consumes that service. The
service provider is configured to only grant access to its service if the
system attempting to consume it has a token issued by the same authorization
system of that local cloud.

The example should serve as a good starting point for getting familiar with
how to use Arrowhead Kalix for integration with Arrowhead local clouds.

## Setup Project under Eclipse

The following instructions explain how to setup the `echo-cloud` example under eclipse. 

1. Clone repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/arrowhead-f/arrowhead-kalix-examples.git`
2. Open eclipse and select *Import* -> *Maven* -> *Exisiting Maven Projects*
3. Select as Root Folder "*/path/to/*arrowhead-kalix-examples/echo-cloud" and click *"Finish"*
4. Run (from terminal or within the IDE using *Run AS*) `mvn clean` and `mvn install` 
5. Open the Project's *properties* -> *Java Build Path* -> *Source* Tab
6. Hit *"Add Folder"* and mark **annotations** under *target/generated-sources/*
7. Hit *"Apply and Close"*

Now, the project should be successfully setup.

## Running

This folder contains a [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file that
can be used to spin up a local cloud that tests interaction between the two
mentioned systems. To get the local cloud up and running, make sure you have
Docker and Maven installed on your system before entering the following
commands into a POSIX-terminal positioned in this directory.

```sh
$ mvn clean package
$ docker-compose up --build
```

The second command might have to be preceded by `sudo` if running on a Linux
system. After seeing the Docker network nodes spin up and write to your
terminal, you will discover that the consumer system was not able to discover
the provider system. The reason for this is that there are currently no
authorization and orchestration rules set up to allow for that discovery to
happen.

To make needed configurations, import the _system operator key store_
([`crypto/sysop.p12`](crypto/sysop.p12)) to your web
browser (the password is `123456`). Then use the following addresses to use
the Swagger interfaces of the different services to manually enter the
required rules.

- Service Registry [`https://localhost:8443`](`https://localhost:8443`)
- Authorization [`https://localhost:8445`](`https://localhost:8445`)
- Orchestrator [`https://localhost:8441`](`https://localhost:8441`)

For more information about how to setup the rules, please consult
[`https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring/blob/master/README.md`](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring/blob/master/README.md).

After the rules are setup, take down the local cloud and take it up again.
If the rules were configured correctly, the interaction should now proceed
without incident.
