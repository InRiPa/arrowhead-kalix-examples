# Arrowhead Kalix Examples

`ar:kalix` is a set of Java libraries designed to simplify the creation of
Arrowhead Framework compliant industrial IoT systems. The libraries provide a
platform for modern asynchronous I/O, utilities for seamless message
encoding/decoding, robust abstractions for creating and communicating with
Arrowhead-compliant systems, as well as a plugin-system that makes it
convenient to reuse service integrations.

This repository contains examples of how the `ar:kalix` libraries may be used.
The following examples are currently available:

| Name           | Description                |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| [`echo`][echo] | An echo client and system. |

[echo]: echo/
